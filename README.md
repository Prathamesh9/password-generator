# Password Generator

I have created a basic Java Application which will provide users with three main options and based on the options selcted by the user the system will perform the appropriate task.

### Option 1 : Generate Password
In this option user can choose whether they want to use Uppercase, Lowercase letter or Numbers or symbols in their password and finnaly the length of thepassword. Based on the options they have selected the system will generate a random password.

### Option 2: Password Strength Check
In this option the user will enter their password and the system will check for criterias that should be present in an ideal password and generate a score and based on the this score the system will decide whether the password is Strong, Good or weak.

### Option 3: Useful Information
The user can opt for this option if they want to learn about the basic criterias and conditions that should be followed while generating a strong password.
